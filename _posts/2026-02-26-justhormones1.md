title: "Are Youth Politics Just Hormones?"

Older adults often remark—sometimes indulgently, sometimes cynically—that young people are “more open-minded,” or conversely, “more easily influenced.” Political parties, religious movements, alternative subcultures, and popular brands have long acted on the tacit assumption that late adolescence is a decisive window for affiliation. What if this intuition has a developmental basis? Lately, I’ve been making my way through *Becoming Human*, a book by developmental psychologist Michael Tomasello of Duke University. In contrast to strands of evolutionary psychology that treat key aspects of social cognition as largely innate—pre-programmed cognitive modules that unfold with maturation—Tomasello argues for a gradual, socially scaffolded ontogeny. He describes an earlier developmental shift in which children move from a form of shared intentionality, visible already in infancy and robust by around age three. This first phase can be summed up as: “You and I attend to this together,” sharing attention and goals. Later, this gives way to what he calls a reflective or “third-position” stance. Around age four or five, children become capable of understanding that beliefs are representations that can be mistaken. They do not merely coordinate with another person; they can step outside the interaction and grasp the relation between perspectives. This recursive capacity—the ability to represent representations—grounds shared norms, conventions, and group commitments.

Reading Tomasello alongside mid century anthropologists such as Gregory Bateson and Claude Lévi-Strauss invites further speculation. Bateson’s account of higher-order learning emphasizes the moment when organisms become sensitive not simply to signals but to the context of signaling, the patterns of difference that organize experience, similar to what linguistic anthropologist Michael Silverstein calls a “metapragmatic frame.” Lévi-Strauss, in turn, argued that human cultures are structured by symmetrical oppositions: right/left, red/blue, clan A/clan B. My proposal is that late adolescence constitutes a third, adaptive developmental period in which individuals become exquisitely sensitive to these symmetrical differences at the level of political and subcultural affiliation. Just as there appears to be a critical period for language acquisition—after which new languages are learned by grafting rules onto an already stabilized core—so too there may be a period in which one acquires a kind of fluency in semiotic affiliation: an attunement to the deployment of color, dress, hairstyle, music, posture, and slogan. After this period, shifts are possible, but they often feel like translation rather than native speech.

Despite the cheeky title of this entry, I would not say that the speculative “third critical period” I am proposing is entirely reducible to hormones. Rather, the rise in pubertal hormones coincides with major neurodevelopmental changes, including synaptic pruning (a reduction in gray matter density as unused connections are eliminated) and continued myelination (the strengthening of white-matter pathways), processes that extend well into early adulthood. Adolescence in humans is unusually prolonged relative to other primates, and many evolutionary anthropologists argue that this extended plasticity may itself be adaptive. During this period, an overabundance of relatively plastic synaptic connections is gradually pared back, leaving fewer but more efficient neural circuits, while endocrine changes reshape motivation, risk sensitivity, and social salience.

I posit that this allows young people to experiment with recursive group positioning: not merely “I align with you” or “I am part of an overarching social order,” but “I belong to this side in contrast to that side of the social order.” In linguistic theory, the Chomskyan notion of Merge describes the capacity to combine elements recursively into hierarchical structures. Analogously, adolescent social cognition may enable the recursive embedding of identities: my cohort within a moiety, my subculture within a polity, my team within a nation. Coming-of-age rituals across societies—whether organized around moiety, phratry, age set, sports allegiance, or political faction—crystallize precisely this attentiveness to structured difference. The Blues and Greens of Constantinople (the two chariot racing teams whose fans famously burned much of the city during the Nika riots), and the ritualized “left” and “right” mapped onto the body, are not mere rivalries but semiotic architectures that require a mind capable of perceiving symmetrical contrast.

My reading of Tomasello is ongoing, but it has been intellectually bracing to follow these biological arguments into conversation with structural anthropology and semiotics, and to let the physical and symbolic streams of our discipline converge rather than run in parallel.
